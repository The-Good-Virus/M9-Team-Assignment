# M9-Team-Assignment
- This repository is for the teamwork of group 9

# For this teamwork assignment we tested and dismantled a code given out during class. We discovered ahead of time that is was a code for an average
# Desktop calculator. After removing and adding different parts of the code from adjusting the numeric orders to removing button functions we learned
# That the code only responds to some changes by either revealing incorrect answers, missing buttons, or not being able to punch in normal questions.
# Either that or refusing to opperate due to an error or a missing component that was vital for the codes ability to function.
# Overall when it comes to the code it has a great presentation, controled order, and a proper use of various python algorithms that are ledgible to some
# Degree for the coder and python.
