3) Document the code in the program where indicated with '#Document what the lines of code do here' in as much detail as possible. This should be a collaborative activity where the documentation goes back and forth on the main file that is in Github. Your commits should reflect a back and forth process. 

4) Once the program has been documented you are finished. Note, some areas have been documented for you for clarity purposes.
