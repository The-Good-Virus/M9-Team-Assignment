# M9-Team-Assignment
This repository is for the teamwork of group 9

# The goal for the group assignment is to do the following

- Download and analyze the file included in this Module called some_ python_program.py.

0) Create a github repo, add the program and a readme to your repo.

1) Run the program and observe what it does.

2) As a team, take a look at the code, try to take out or comment out lines to see how the program behaves. Observe if the Graphical User Interface (GUI) has changed in any way or if the behavior of the program is different. As a team, analyze the code and identify what lines or sections of the code do.

3) Document the code in the program where indicated with '#Document what the lines of code do here' in as much detail as possible. This should be a collaborative activity where the documentation goes back and forth on the main file that is in Github. Your commits should reflect a back and forth process. 

4) Once the program has been documented you are finished. Note, some areas have been documented for you for clarity purposes.


# The following program has proven to be functional and reveals to be a calculator that appears on the left side of the screen

# The user is able to type in any simple or complexed mathematical question into the calculator and it will show the correct answer

# The coder stated in the code that they didn't use the Lamba function but despite that the code still runs like a regular calculator

# The coder used the code "tkinter" to create the graphical interface for the calculator. To make the calculator interactive the buttons and command functions allow the user to punch in the numbers and symbols seen on the calculator

# By removing root.mainloop() it'll completely cancel out everything.

# The button lines act as the buttons on the calculator.

# This line is the function for the mathematical equations the user inputs.

# The lines of code for button_1.grid(row=3, column=0) are what puts the buttons in a certain order.

# def button_equal(): This section of code is where the math starts from adding, multiplying, subtracting, and dividing. An example of what it should look like is this if num_operator == '+':.

# root.title("Simple Calculator") This line of code is the calculator's name.

# def button_clear(): e.delete(0, END) This line is the clear button that completely erases whatever function you input into the calculator. 

# By removing this line button_subtract.grid(row=6, column=0), it'll remove a button from the calculator, which, in this case, removes the subtraction button.
